There are 4 kinds of graphs in HTML5.jp.

* vertical bar chart
* radar chart
* line chart
* pie chart

With this plugin, you can easily draw graphs using helper methods. 
Helper methods accepts both simple array data and your original complex model objects.

== Install

  > git clone git://github.com/nay/html5jp_graphs.git vendor/plugins/html5jp_graphs

If you use Rails 2.1 or later, you can install with this command.

  > ruby script/plugin install git://github.com/nay/html5jp_graphs.git

==Set Up

First of all, you need to include javascripts. You can include these files by using :all option.

 <%= javascript_include_tag :all %>
 
Also you can include required files separately.

* required for all graphs ... excanvas.js, excanvas-compressed.js
* vertical bar chart ... vbar.js
* radar chart ... radar.js
* pie chart ... circle.js
* line chart ... line.js

Then, add :htmltjp_graphs as a helper in your controllers.

 class GraphsController < ApplicationController
   helper :html5jp_graphs
 end

==Example
=== Draw a Vertical Bar Chart

  <%= vertical_bar_chart [['accesses', 520, 340, 804, 602], ['clicks', 101, 76, 239, 321]] %>
  
   or you can use your own model obejct (with some methods. Please see RDoc for the requirements).

  <%= vertical_bar_chart access_click_summaries %>
 
=== Draw a Radar Chart

  <%= radar_chart [['review1', 5, 4, 3], ['review2', 3, 5, 2]], :aCap => ['price', 'style', 'sound'] %>
 
  <%= radar_chart reviews %>
 
=== Draw a Line Chart

  <%= line_chart [['accesses', 520, 340, 804, 602], ['clicks', 101, 76, 239, 321]] %>
  
  <%= line_chart access_click_summaries %>

=== Draw a Pie Chart

  <%= pie_chart([["very good", 400], ["good", 300], ["bad", 100], ["very bad", 300]]) %>

  <%= pie_chart opinions %>

=== Options

You can use all options in HTML5.jp. Note that string options should be wrapped in ' ', or it would be used as a script code.

For example, to specify the backgroundColor option to a radar chart, write like this.

  <%= radar_chart reviews, :backgroundColor => "'red'" %>
